=================================

## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demostrate ability in the getting and cleaning data.  

The subject matter for this project is a dataset from UCI for Human Activity Recgonition Using Smartphones.

The dataset was provided by the course instructure with a link, however the dara set is also available at:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The course instructures for this project include (from the course page)

1. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


## Files

### run_analysis.R
R Code to create the tidy data.  Reads all the inputs, merges the test and training data, cleans up the 
variable names, and then creates a tidy data with the means for the subjects and activities

### tidyData_means.txt

the dataset submitted to coursera

### tidyData.txt

The larger all samples data set with subject Id and the activity labels.


##  THANKS!

Have a great week reviewing!
